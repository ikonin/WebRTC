Fork of WebRTC project for local usage

How to build:
1. Get original WebRTC project according to this: https://sites.google.com/site/webrtc/reference/getting-started
3. Create smwebrtc directory inside of webrtc svn tree at the same level as trunk.
2. Change dir to smwebrtc.
4. Clone repo to smwebrtc folder: 'git clone git@github.com:ikonin/WebRTC.git ./'
5. Find .gclient file in root of webrtc svn and replace
   "name"        : "trunk", 
   with 
   "name"        : "smwebrtc",
   This will tell gclient which tree to build from.
6. Run 'gclient runhooks --force' to generate native platform project
